# Customer-Churn-Prediction

This repo is containing my practice project to create prediction using basic concept ANN of deep learning.

## About Dataset

__Context__ <br>
"Predict behavior to retain customers. You can analyze all relevant customer data and develop focused customer retention programs." [IBM Sample Data Sets]
<br>
<br>

__Content__ <br>
Each row represents a customer, each column contains customer’s attributes described on the column Metadata.
<br>
<br>


__The data set includes information about:__

- Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn
- Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
- Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges
- Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents
<br>
<br>

__Inspiration__<br>
To explore this type of models and learn more about the subject.

## Goals of this notebook 

### Insight Finding

1. How is rate of churn customer in latest month?
2. How is trend of tenure from churn customer?
3. Does demografic of customer affecting the behaviour of churn customer?
4. How is customer behaviour related their account attributes?
5. How is behaviour of account attributes from churn customer?

### Prediction Modeling
1. Building a model which could predict wether customer will be churn or not based on their behaviour.
